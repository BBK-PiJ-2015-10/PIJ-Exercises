This repo was created to facilitate the review of all the exercises from the PIJ module.

During the course of the module, at the end of each lecture session all exercises were
loaded into individual git repositories (with the excepion of the groovy ones). 
You can find them in this same account BBK-PiJ-2015-10 . 
You will see the timely submission of all of them. I only did some clean up in the last
couple of days to delete class files that had been loaded and loaded the groovy exercises
that were done in October but hand't been loaded.

Should you have any questions. Please don't hesitate to contact me at:
